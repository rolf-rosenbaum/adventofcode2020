The task is to count trees on a hillside. The slope itself is represented by a piece of text, where a dot ('.') represents 
open space, and a hash ('#') represents a tree.

When going down the slope at a certain angle, how many trees does one encounter? 

For example:  

    ..##.......
    #...#...#..
    .#....#..#.
    ..#.#...#.#
    .#...##..#.
    ..#.##.....
    .#.#.#....#
    .#........#
    #.##...#...
    #...##....#
    .#..#...#.#

These aren't the only trees, though; the above pattern repeats to the right indefinitely, like this:

    ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
    #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
    .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
    ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
    .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
    ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
    .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
    .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
    #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
    #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
    .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->

You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
The angle at which you go down is 3 to the right, 1 down with each step.
From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. 
Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.

The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:

    ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
    #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
    .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
    ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
    .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
    ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
    .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
    .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
    #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
    #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
    .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->

In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter 7 trees.

Starting in the top-left corner of your map and following an angle of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
Your map is defined in resources/input.txt.
