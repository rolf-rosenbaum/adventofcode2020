## We want to count trees on a hillside. 
The hillside is represented by a number of characters, where a dot ('.') represents open space, 
and a hash ('#') represents a tree.

For example:  

    ..##.......
    #...#...#..
    .#....#..#.
    ..#.#...#.#
    .#...##..#.
    ..#.##.....
    .#.#.#....#
    .#........#
    #.##...#...
    #...##....#
    .#..#...#.#

These aren't the only trees, though; the above pattern repeats to the right indefinitely, like this:

    ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
    #...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
    .#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
    ..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
    .#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
    ..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
    .#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
    .#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
    #.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
    #...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
    .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->


### When going down the slope at a certain angle, how many trees does one encounter?

You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
The angle at which you go down is ***3 to the right, 1 down with each step***.
From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is ***right 3 and down 1***. 
Then, check the position that is ***right 3 and down 1*** from there, and so on ***until you go past the bottom of the map***.

The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where there was an open square and X where there was a tree:

    ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
    #..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
    .#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
    ..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
    .#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
    ..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
    .#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
    .#........#.#........X.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
    #.##...#...#.##...#...#.X#...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
    #...##....##...##....##...#X....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
    .#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->

In this example, traversing the map using this angle would cause you to encounter 7 trees.

Starting in the top-left corner of your map and following an angle of right 3 and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
Your map is defined in resources/input.txt.
